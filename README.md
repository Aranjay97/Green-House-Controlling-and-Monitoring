# Green House Controlling and Monitoring

Embedded C

The rising demands for crop production and quality have significantly increased the utilization of high quality and productivity of green house. The system which we proposed helps us to closely monitor and control the microclimatic parameters of a greenhouse environment. The system comprises of sensors, microcontroller with inbuilt ADC and actuators (motors, led). When temperature crosses a safety threshold which has to be maintained to protect the crops, the sensors sense the change and the micro-controller reads this from the data at its input ports after being converted to a digital form by the ADC. The controller then performs the required actions using actuators until the strayed-out parameter has been brought back to its most optimum level. Our proposed system aim is to design a microcontroller-based circuit to monitor and record the values of temperature of the natural environment that are continuously modified and it is get controlled in order optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and yield.
